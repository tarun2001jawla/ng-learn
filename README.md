## Introduction

This repository is a sandbox for learning and experimenting with **Angular**. I'll be adding projects and examples that showcase various features and concepts, from the basics of Angular components to advanced topics like state management, routing, and more.

If you're learning Angular as well, feel free to explore the code, raise issues, or even contribute!

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: The web framework I am focusing on.
- **TypeScript**: Angular's primary language, which is a typed superset of JavaScript.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous data streams and reactive programming.
- **SCSS**: For styling components.
- **Node.js & npm**: For managing dependencies and running the development environment.
